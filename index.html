            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>
                Ever since I was a little kid, I used to love music. Rock, Jazz, Rap, and a lot of other genres struck me from a young age.
                <br><br>
                It was only a matter of time until I picked up an instrument and started playing. I went from playing the violin at the age of 5 to the recorder and eventually picking up the guitar at the age of 7.
                <br><br>
                Playing instruments was a big part of my life, and I even went on to play in bands with friends and perform concerts. Eventually, I kind of grew out of that hobby, and by the age of 16, I stopped playing instruments altogether. At that point, I had spent a lot of my life trying to learn instruments and singing.
                <br><br>
                I realized that learning instruments is hard and tedious, often involving spending a lot of time just repeating the same things over and over again.
                <br><br>
                However, I never stopped listening to music, and eventually, I picked up the instruments again. I started on the guitar and found a newfound joy in playing.
                <br><br>
                Playing music for me is not just about the music—because, well, listening to it usually sounds better than playing it yourself. But being able to get into a groove and just play things is a feeling you only get from doing it yourself.
                <br><br>
                So, on this website, I will be going through some of my tips on how to play music and make it fun, even though we might not be professional musicians. I will also cover the expected costs for playing instruments.

        <h2>Tips:</h2>
        <p>Getting back into music taught me that you don't need to be a professional to enjoy it. My biggest realization was that the 'hard and tedious' part becomes a lot easier if you actually enjoy what you are playing. If you force yourself to learn boring exercises, you will quit. But if you learn that one riff from your favorite song, you will play for hours without noticing. My number one trick? Keep your instrument visible. If it's hidden in a case under the bed, you will never play it. Put it on a stand right in your living room so you can just grab it and play for 5 minutes whenever you feel like it.</p>

        <ul>
            <h3>Dos</h3>
            <li>Play what you actually listen to. Don't start with "Mary Had a Little Lamb" if you listen to Metallica or Kendrick Lamar. Find a simplified version of the songs you love. It keeps the fire alive when your fingers start hurting.</li>
            <li>Consistency beats intensity. It is way better to play for 10 minutes every day than to binge-practice for 5 hours on a Sunday. Your brain needs sleep to process the muscle memory, so short, daily sessions will make you learn faster.</li>
            <li>Record yourself (even if it's cringe). It is hard to hear your own progress day-to-day. If you record a video on your phone once a week, you can look back after a month and actually hear how much better you have gotten. That is the best motivation there is.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div id="donts">
        <ul>
            <h3>Don'ts</h3>
            <li>Don't compare yourself to YouTube/TikTok prodigies. Remember that the guy playing that insane solo in a 15-second clip probably did 50 takes to get it right. Comparing your "behind the scenes" to someone else's "highlight reel" will just make you want to quit.</li>
            <li>Don't dive too deep into Music Theory at the start. Unless you are a nerd for math, learning scales and modes immediately is the quickest way to kill the fun. Learn to play songs first; understanding why they work can come later when you are already hooked. But don't underestimate music theory this is what teaches you to improvise</li>
            <li>Don't stop just because your fingers hurt. Whether it is guitar strings or just awkward hand positions on a keyboard, it will feel uncomfortable at first. This is normal. Take a break, shake your hands out, but don't quit. Your hands will get stronger, and eventually, you won't even feel it.</li>
